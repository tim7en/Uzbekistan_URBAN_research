```

### 🎯 Analysis Unit Coverage

The project provides comprehensive analysis capabilities through 5 main analysis units:

1. **Nightlight Analysis** (`run_nightlight_unit.py`)
   - VIIRS monthly nightlight data processing
   - Urban illumination intensity analysis
   - Temporal trend detection

2. **Land Use/Land Cover (LULC)** (`run_lulc_unit.py`)
   - ESRI land cover classification
   - Urban expansion analysis
   - Change detection algorithms

3. **Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI)** (`run_suhi_unit.py`)
   - Core temperature difference calculation
   - Multi-sensor LST analysis (MODIS, Landsat, ASTER)
   - Day/night heat island assessment

4. **Auxiliary Data Analysis** (`run_auxiliary_unit.py`)
   - Vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI)
   - Land surface temperature analysis
   - Biomass estimation models

5. **Spatial Relationships** (`run_spatial_relationships_unit.py`)
   - Vegetation vs built-up correlation analysis
   - Multi-variable spatial analysis

### 🚀 Execution Flexibility

The codebase provides multiple execution modes for different use cases:

- **Full Analysis** (`main.py`): Complete pipeline orchestration
- **Smoke Testing** (`run_smoke.py`): Quick validation with subset data
- **Coarse Resolution Testing** (`main_smoke_coarse.py`): Fast processing at 500m resolution
- **Individual Unit Analysis**: Independent execution of each analysis component

## Code Quality Assessment

### ✅ Strengths

1. **Modular Design**
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Reusable components
   - Independent unit testing capability

2. **Configuration Management**
   - Centralized city configuration (14 cities across Uzbekistan)
   - Configurable analysis parameters
   - Flexible coordinate and buffer specifications

3. **Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive exception handling in critical functions
   - Graceful degradation for missing data
   - Validation of configuration parameters

4. **Documentation**
   - 296 lines in README.md with comprehensive usage examples
   - 358 lines in OUTPUTS_ASSESSMENT.md detailing expected outputs
   - Inline documentation throughout codebase

5. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Custom unit test framework (created during this review)
   - Smoke tests for rapid validation
   - Simulation capabilities for testing without GEE authentication

### ⚠️ Minor Issues Identified

1. **Output Directory Structure**
   - Two directories (nightlights, lulc) not automatically created
   - **Impact**: Low - directories created on-demand during analysis
   - **Recommendation**: Add to `create_output_directories()` function

2. **Google Earth Engine Dependency**
   - Full functionality requires GEE authentication
   - **Impact**: Expected for geospatial analysis project
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing framework created to validate without GEE
