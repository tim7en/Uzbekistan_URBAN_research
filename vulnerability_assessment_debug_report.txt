3. CONTRADICTION ANALYSIS
========================================
Identifying logical inconsistencies in the assessment:

⚠️  Gulistan: High air quality hazard (0.836) but low air pollution vulnerability (0.400)
⚠️  Nurafshon: High air quality hazard (0.956) but low air pollution vulnerability (0.300)
⚠️  Nurafshon: Small city bias - low exposure (0.078) may inflate adaptability (0.629)


4. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED
=============================================
🔍 All cities have identical heat_hazard values (0.500) - likely hardcoded
🔍 All cities have identical pluvial_hazard values (0.500) - likely hardcoded
🔍 Tashkent has fragmentation_vulnerability = 1.000 (maximum value - check if realistic)
🔍 Tashkent has air_pollution_vulnerability = 1.000 (maximum value - check if realistic)
🔍 Samarkand has fragmentation_vulnerability = 1.000 (maximum value - check if realistic)
🔍 Samarkand has air_pollution_vulnerability = 1.000 (maximum value - check if realistic)
🔍 Namangan has air_pollution_vulnerability = 1.000 (maximum value - check if realistic)
🔍 Namangan has gdp_adaptive_capacity = 0.000 (minimum value - check if realistic)
🔍 Navoiy has dry_hazard = 1.000 (maximum value - check if realistic)
🔍 Termez has dry_hazard = 1.000 (maximum value - check if realistic)
🔍 Termez has gdp_adaptive_capacity = 0.000 (minimum value - check if realistic)


5. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT
========================================
1. Review air pollution vulnerability calculation - should correlate with air quality hazard
2. Consider weighting economic capacity more heavily in final adaptability score
3. Implement size-adjusted exposure metrics to reduce small city bias
4. Add cross-validation checks for contradictory component values
5. Use percentile ranking for all components to ensure proper distribution
6. Consider local context factors (e.g., industrial cities, mining towns)
7. Validate component calculations against ground truth data where available
