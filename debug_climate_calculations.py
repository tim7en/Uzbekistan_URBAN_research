THORNTHWAITE METHOD LIMITATIONS:

1. TEMPERATURE-BASED APPROACH:
   ‚úÖ Good for energy-limited environments
   ‚ùå May underestimate PET in arid regions where radiation is limiting
   ‚ùå Doesn't account for wind, humidity, or radiation explicitly

2. SUITABILITY FOR UZBEKISTAN:
   - Uzbekistan has extreme continental climate
   - High summer temperatures (40¬∞C+)
   - Low humidity, high radiation
   - Thornthwaite may underestimate PET significantly

3. ALTERNATIVE METHODS:
   - Penman-Monteith: More physically based, accounts for radiation
   - Hargreaves: Simpler but better for arid regions
   - Priestley-Taylor: Good for radiation-limited environments

4. EXPECTED IMPROVEMENT:
   - Penman-Monteith would likely give 20-40% higher PET
   - AI would decrease from ~0.3 to ~0.15-0.2
   - More consistent with arid classification

CHIRPS PRECIPITATION DATA:

1. DATA CHARACTERISTICS:
   ‚úÖ Satellite-based rainfall estimates
   ‚úÖ Bias-corrected using gauge data
   ‚úÖ 0.05¬∞ spatial resolution
   ‚úÖ Good performance in arid regions

2. UZBEKISTAN PRECIPITATION PATTERNS:
   - Northern regions (Tashkent): 300-500 mm/year
   - Central regions (Samarkand): 200-400 mm/year
   - Southern regions (Termez): 100-200 mm/year
   - Western desert (Nukus): 80-150 mm/year

3. VALIDATION CONCERNS:
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Sparse gauge network in desert regions
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Satellite estimates may have higher uncertainty
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Temporal coverage (2001-2020) may include wetter periods

4. EXPECTED ACCURACY:

   - Moderate: ¬±30% in desert areas
   - May overestimate in some arid regions

    print("""
IMMEDIATE IMPROVEMENTS:

1. PET METHOD UPGRADE:
   - Replace Thornthwaite with Hargreaves or Penman-Monteith
   - Hargreaves: PET = 0.0023 * Ra * (T_max - T_min)^0.5 * (T_mean + 17.8)
   - Better suited for arid regions with limited humidity data

2. ARIDITY INDEX ADJUSTMENT:
   - Apply regional correction factors
   - Use K√∂ppen climate classification as validation
   - Cross-reference with local meteorological data

3. VALIDATION AGAINST OBSERVED DATA:
   - Compare with Uzbekistan meteorological stations
   - Validate against FAO aridity maps
   - Use GRACE satellite water storage data

4. SPATIAL CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Account for urban heat island effects
   - Consider oasis vs desert microclimates
   - Use appropriate buffer sizes for climate analysis

LONG-TERM IMPROVEMENTS:

1. MULTI-SOURCE VALIDATION:
   - Cross-validate with multiple PET methods
   - Use ensemble approach for uncertainty quantification
   - Incorporate local meteorological observations

2. DYNAMIC CALIBRATION:
   - Calibrate PET methods using local data
   - Adjust for elevation and terrain effects
   - Account for irrigation impacts on local climate
