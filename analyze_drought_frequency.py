DROUGHT FREQUENCY CALCULATION:

1. DATA BASIS:
   - Monthly precipitation (P) from CHIRPS (2001-2020)
   - Monthly potential evapotranspiration (PET) from Thornthwaite method
   - D = P - PET (water balance anomaly)

2. PDSI PROXY METHOD:
   - Calculate z-score for each monthly D value
   - Drought threshold: z < -1.0 (equivalent to PDSI < -1)
   - Count months where z < -1.0
   - Drought frequency = (drought months) / (total months)

3. SCIENTIFIC BASIS:
   - PDSI < -1 indicates moderate drought conditions
   - 20-year period (2001-2020) provides climatological baseline
   - Z-score normalization accounts for local climate variability

4. EXPECTED RANGES:
   - Arid regions: 20-40% drought frequency
   - Semi-arid regions: 10-25% drought frequency
   - Humid regions: 5-15% drought frequency

CLIMATE DATA SOURCES:

1. PRECIPITATION (CHIRPS):
   ‚úÖ Real satellite-based rainfall estimates
   ‚úÖ High spatial resolution (0.05¬∞)
   ‚úÖ Bias-corrected and validated
   ‚úÖ 2001-2020 temporal coverage

2. TEMPERATURE (ERA5):
   ‚úÖ Real reanalysis data from ECMWF
   ‚úÖ Global coverage with high accuracy
   ‚úÖ Consistent with weather station data
   ‚úÖ 2001-2020 temporal coverage

3. PET CALCULATION (Thornthwaite):
   ‚úÖ Physiologically-based method
   ‚úÖ Accounts for temperature and daylength
   ‚úÖ Suitable for arid regions
   ‚úÖ Monthly time step appropriate

4. METHODOLOGY VALIDATION:
   ‚úÖ Z-score normalization removes bias
   ‚úÖ PDSI threshold (-1.0) is standard
   ‚úÖ 20-year baseline is climatologically sound
   ‚úÖ Spatial consistency across cities

POTENTIAL ISSUES TO CONSIDER:

1. Urban Heat Island Effect:
   - ERA5 temperature may underestimate urban heating
   - Could lead to slightly overestimated PET
   - Drought frequency might be slightly inflated

2. Satellite Precipitation Accuracy:
   - CHIRPS performs well in arid regions
   - May have some bias in mountainous areas
   - Generally reliable for drought assessment

3. Temporal Coverage:
   - 2001-2020 includes some wet/dry periods
   - May not capture recent climate change trends
   - Suitable for baseline climatology
