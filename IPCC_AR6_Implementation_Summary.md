# IPCC AR6 Climate Risk Assessment Implementation Summary

## ✅ Fixed Implementation

The climate risk assessment has been updated to **fully comply** with the IPCC AR6 framework specification you provided. Here are the key improvements:

## 1. Complete Multi-Hazard Assessment

**Before**: Only heat hazard was calculated
**After**: All four hazard types with correct weights:

```python
# Heat hazard (H_heat): 60% weight - summer mean LST, day/night SUHI
# Dry/ecological stress (H_dry): 25% weight - low NDVI/EVI, negative seasonal changes  
# Pluvial proxy (H_pluv): 10% weight - built-up share and edge density
# Dust proxy (H_dust): 5% weight - bare/low-veg share and fragmentation

H = 0.60 * H_heat + 0.25 * H_dry + 0.10 * H_pluv + 0.05 * H_dust
```

## 2. Corrected Exposure Calculation

**Before**: Incorrect components and weights
**After**: Exact specification compliance:

```python
E = 0.60 * E_pop + 0.25 * E_gdp + 0.15 * E_viirs
```

Where:
- `E_pop`: Population exposure (normalized)
- `E_gdp`: Composition-weighted City GDP 
- `E_viirs`: VIIRS urban radiance

## 3. Complete Vulnerability Assessment

**Before**: Missing fragmentation and biomass trend components
**After**: All four vulnerability components:

```python
V = 0.40 * V_income_inv + 0.30 * V_veg_access + 0.20 * V_fragment + 0.10 * V_delta_bio_veg
```

Where:
- `V_income_inv`: Inverted GDP per capita (lower income = higher vulnerability)
- `V_veg_access`: Distance to vegetation (higher distance = higher vulnerability)
- `V_fragment`: Vegetation patch fragmentation
- `V_delta_bio_veg`: Negative biomass/vegetation trends

## 4. Proper Adaptive Capacity Calculation

**Before**: Incorrect components
**After**: Specification-compliant:

```python
AC = 0.50 * AC_gdp_pc + 0.30 * AC_greenspace + 0.20 * AC_services
```

Where:
- `AC_gdp_pc`: GDP per capita adaptive capacity
- `AC_greenspace`: Vegetation area and accessibility
- `AC_services`: VIIRS luminosity as urban services proxy

## 5. Corrected Risk Formula

**Before**: Weighted additive approach (incorrect)
**After**: IPCC AR6 multiplicative formula:

```python
Risk = H × E × V  # Equation 64
```

## 6. Proper Adaptability Calculation

**Before**: Simple inverse calculation
**After**: IPCC AR6 formula:

```python
Adaptability = AC / (1 + Risk)  # Equation 65
```

## 7. Individual Component Tracking

The `ClimateRiskMetrics` dataclass now tracks all individual components:

- **Hazard components**: `heat_hazard`, `dry_hazard`, `dust_hazard`, `pluvial_hazard`
- **Exposure components**: `population_exposure`, `gdp_exposure`, `viirs_exposure`  
- **Vulnerability components**: `income_vulnerability`, `veg_access_vulnerability`, `fragmentation_vulnerability`, `bio_trend_vulnerability`
- **Adaptive capacity components**: `gdp_adaptive_capacity`, `greenspace_adaptive_capacity`, `services_adaptive_capacity`

## 8. Data Integration

The implementation now properly integrates:

- **Temperature data**: For heat hazard calculation
- **LULC data**: For vegetation trends, built-up area, bare ground
- **Spatial data**: For vegetation accessibility and fragmentation
- **Nightlights data**: For economic activity exposure and services proxy
- **Population data**: For exposure and socioeconomic vulnerability

## 9. Robust Percentile Normalization

All indicators use robust min-max scaling with 10th-90th percentile bounds as specified, avoiding outlier inflation.

## Test Results

The implementation now produces realistic results:

```
✓ Completed assessment for 14 cities
AC median=0.293  IQR=(0.246,0.397)
Risk median=0.073  IQR=(0.033,0.172)

Example results:
Navoiy: H=0.650, E=0.372, V=0.106, AC=0.696, Risk=0.026
Tashkent: H=0.587, E=1.000, V=0.432, AC=0.715, Risk=0.254
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Full IPCC AR6 Compliance**: Implements the exact framework specification
2. **Multi-Hazard Assessment**: Captures heat, dryness, dust, and pluvial risks
3. **Comprehensive Data Integration**: Uses all available urban data sources
4. **Robust Methodology**: Percentile-based normalization with outlier protection
5. **Individual Component Tracking**: Enables detailed analysis and debugging
6. **Seasonal Capability**: Framework ready for seasonal processing

The implementation now provides a comprehensive, scientifically sound climate risk assessment that fully aligns with the IPCC AR6 framework for Uzbekistan's urban context.

## 10. Water Scarcity Assessment Integration

**New Feature**: Comprehensive water scarcity risk assessment module

### Implementation Details

The water scarcity assessment evaluates water-related risks using IPCC AR6 water hazard indicators:

```python
# Water Scarcity Assessment Components
water_supply_risk = 0.60 * supply_indicators + 0.40 * surface_water_change
water_demand_risk = 0.70 * cropland_demand + 0.30 * population_pressure  
overall_water_scarcity_score = 0.60 * supply_risk + 0.40 * demand_risk
```

### Water Scarcity Indicators

**Supply-side indicators** (60% weight):
- **Aridity Index** (AI): P/PET ratio (lower = drier baseline)
- **Climatic Water Deficit** (CWD): Unmet water demand (higher = greater deficit)
- **Drought Frequency**: Fraction of months with PDSI ≤ -2

**Surface water indicators**:
- **JRC GSW Change**: Surface water area change (negative = loss)

**Demand proxies** (40% weight):
- **Cropland Fraction**: ESA WorldCover agricultural land %
- **Population Density**: GPW population pressure indicator

**External benchmarks**:
- **Aqueduct BWS Score**: WRI baseline water stress (1-5 scale)

### Risk Classification

```python
if score >= 0.7: "Critical"
elif score >= 0.5: "High" 
elif score >= 0.3: "Moderate"
else: "Low"
```

### Usage

```bash
# Run water scarcity assessment for all cities
python run_water_scarcity_unit.py --assess --export-json

# Run for specific cities with verbose output
python run_water_scarcity_unit.py --assess --cities Tashkent Nukus --verbose

# Generate summary report only
python run_water_scarcity_unit.py --summary
```

### Uzbekistan Results

Recent assessment shows concerning water scarcity patterns:

```
Total Cities: 14
Average Score: 0.516 (High risk)
Risk Distribution: High (11 cities), Moderate (3 cities)

Top Risk Cities:
1. Nukus: 0.553 (High) - Aral Sea region water stress
2. Urgench: 0.553 (High) - Khorezm region irrigation demands  
3. Andijan: 0.524 (High) - Fergana Valley agriculture
4. Namangan: 0.524 (High) - Dense population pressure
5. Fergana: 0.524 (High) - Regional water competition
```

### Integration with Climate Risk Framework

Water scarcity metrics are integrated into the main `ClimateRiskMetrics` dataclass:

```python
@dataclass
class ClimateRiskMetrics:
    # ... existing climate components ...
    
    # Water scarcity components
    water_supply_risk: float = 0.0
    water_demand_risk: float = 0.0  
    overall_water_scarcity_score: float = 0.0
    water_scarcity_level: str = "Unknown"
```

This enables comprehensive multi-hazard risk assessment including both climate and water-related vulnerabilities for Uzbekistan's urban areas.
