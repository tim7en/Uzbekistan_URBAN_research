## Description
This visualization presents Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) analysis results, showing temperature differences between urban and rural areas. SUHI effects are critical indicators of urban climate impact and inform heat mitigation strategies.

**Key Elements:**
- Temperature differentials across urban landscapes
- Spatial distribution of heat island intensities
- Temporal patterns and trends in urban heating
- City-specific SUHI characteristics

**Scientific Significance:**
SUHI analysis is essential for understanding urban climate impacts, planning heat mitigation strategies, and assessing the effectiveness of green infrastructure interventions.

## Usage in Dashboard
This visualization enhances the interactive dashboard by providing geographic context that support user exploration and understanding of urban development patterns.
