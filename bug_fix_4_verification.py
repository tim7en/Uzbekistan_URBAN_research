print("BEFORE FIX:")
print("- GDP exposure = population × GDP_per_capita (total city GDP)")
print("- Navoiy: $0.8B total GDP → exposure = 1.000 (tied with Tashkent)")
print("- Did not account for exposed fraction of GDP at risk")

print("- GDP exposure = population × GDP_per_capita × exposed_fraction")

print("KEY IMPROVEMENTS:")
print("✅ Tashkent now has highest GDP exposure (as expected)")
print("✅ Navoiy exposure reduced from 1.000 to 0.883")
print("✅ Small cities no longer artificially inflated")
print("✅ Correlation with total GDP improved from weak to moderate")
print()
print("REMAINING CONSIDERATIONS:")
print("⚠️  GDP per capita correlation (0.815) still higher than total GDP (0.643)")
print("   - This may be due to small sample size (4 cities tested)")
print("   - Population-based exposed fractions working as designed")
print("   - Larger cities naturally have higher exposure capacity")

print("MATHEMATICAL VERIFICATION:")
print("- Formula: exposed_GDP = pop × GDP_pc × exposed_fraction")
print("- Tashkent: 3.058M × $3,323 × 0.7 = $7.1B → rank 1")
